Monitoring Containers
=====================

Importing the dashboards
------------------------

grafana-pcp includes the following (optional) dashboards:

* PCP Vector: Container Overview (CGroups v1)
* PCP Vector: Container Overview (CGroups v2)

You can import the corresponding dashboard on the :doc:`../datasources/vector` data source settings page.

.. note::
   grafana-pcp before version 3.0.0 includes a single dashboard called **PCP Vector: Container Overview** which supports CGroups v1 only and is installed by default (i.e. no import is required).

Usage
-----

You can choose one or multiple containers in the *container* drop-down field at the top of the dashboard:

Common Problems
---------------

**My container doesn't show up**

- make sure that the docker and/or podman PMDAs are installed
- currently PCP only supports containers started by the root user (there is `an open feature request <https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/issues/913>`_ to change this)
